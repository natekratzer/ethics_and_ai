## Lending to Maximize Profit

https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/

- Why does the profit maximizing strategy treat the two groups differently? What information does this mean a profit-maximizing model would include?
- Is it okay for private actors to adopt the profit-maximizing strategy?

## Group Unaware Lending

https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/

- What happens in the group unaware scenario? 
- Why are the true positive rates so different between the groups?
- How often do we see the group unaware scenario suggested as a solution in real life?
- Is this a fair solution?

## Demographic Parity

https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/

- An equal percent of each group gets a loan. Is this fair?
- Should we focus on the true positive rate instead?
- The true positive rate involves explicitly setting different thresholds for different groups, is that okay?

## Lending Problem

https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/

- Should banks be responsible for setting a fairness standard (e.g. equal true positive rates)? If so, what standard and for which groups?
- If banks should only maximize profit, should there be a set of regulartory constraints setting up a constrained optimization problem for banks? If so, what constraints?

## Delayed Impact

https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/05/17/delayed-impact/

- What is the threshold range for each group within which credit scores are improved over time? What is the threshold that maximizes it? Why?
- Why do we care about future credit scores?

## Multiple Impacts

https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/05/17/delayed-impact/

- If we have two things we care about (immediate loans and future credit scores) can we maximize for both of them?
- How do we determine what we care most about? Who gets to determine that?
- Is average group credit score the only long-term effect we should care about? If it's not, what other impacts should we keep in mind?

## Feedback Loops and Fairness

https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/ml-fairness-gym-tool-for-exploring-long.html

- What are two issues with doing a fairness analysis on a hold-out 'test' set of data?
- What lending rule is best for the disadvantage group?

## Groups over Time

https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/05/17/delayed-impact/

- Why don't equal True Positive Rates each year mean equal True Positive Rates over time?
- What sort of difficulties are posed in a fairness analysis that needs to take into account multiple years?
