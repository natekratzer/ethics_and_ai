## Defining AI

- For our purposes, any automated judgment or decision process

- This stretches from a simple if-then statement to a deep neural network

- While more complex AI does pose it's own challenges we can imagine a simple if then statement

- IF in zip code XXXXX THEN deny loan

## Statistics and Machine Learning

- Statistics has the data and the rules and comes up the the answers
- Machine Learning has the data and the answers and comes up with the rules

- The rules then get used on new cases

> models, despite their reputation for impartiality, reflect goals and ideology. ... Our own values and desires influence our choices, from the data we choose to collect to the questions we ask. Models are opinions embedded in matehmatics

## Ethics as a matter of taste

- This is usually a criticism, and while I don't think it's a perfect analogy, there is something we can take from it.

- While tastes does vary some from person to person, in broad strokes it's actually pretty set
    - Humans like fat, sugar, salt, etc. 
    - Also food tastes better than things that aren't food
    - Within the range of things we agree are edible for humans, yes, there's variation
    - But we all agree that ice cream tastes better than dog shit
    
- Our tastes aren't well adapted to a situation where fat and sugar are plentiful. 

- Our ethical intuition is also not well adapted to the current situation
    - Our naturally good intentions may not be enough in a complicated world
    - Introducing complex AI into a complex society is pushing beyond our intuitive sense of ethics

## Ethical Progress

- There's actually been a lot of this.
    - We now think that it's not only white property holding men who count as people. 
    - That strikes me as more important than any of the technological advances of the past century.

- Sometimes studying ethics makes it seem like nothing is settled, but that's because it's the unsettled cases that are interesting

A just society can't be achieved simply by maximizing utility or by securing freedom of choice. To achieve a just society, we have to reason together about the meaning of the good life, and to create a public culture hospitable to the disagreements that will inevitably arise

Michael Sandel, Justice p. 261
