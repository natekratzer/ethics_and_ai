## Ethics and Justice

- In a broad sense
    - Ethics: personal behavior
    - Justice: social institutions
    
- We will talk some about our personal ethical responsibilities as data scientists

- The question of how AI changes society is a question of Justice

    
- "Justice is what love looks like in public" - Cornel West

## Ethics as a matter of taste

- This is usually a criticism, and while I don't think it's a perfect analogy, there is something we can take from it.

- While tastes does vary some from person to person, in broad strokes it's actually pretty set
    - Humans like fat, sugar, salt, etc. 
    - Also food tastes better than things that aren't food
    - Within the range of things we agree are edible for humans, yes, there's variation
    - But we all agree that ice cream tastes better than dog shit
    
- Our tastes aren't well adapted to a situation where fat and sugar are plentiful. 

- Our ethical intuition is also not well adapted to the current situation
    - Our naturally good intentions may not be enough in a complicated world
    - Introducing complex AI into a complex society is pushing beyond our intuitive sense of ethics

class: bg_water

## Ethical Progress

- There's actually been a lot of this.
    - We now think that it's not only white property holding men who count as people. 
    - That strikes me as more important than any of the technological advances of the past century.

- Sometimes studying ethics makes it seem like nothing is settled, but that's because it's the unsettled cases that are interesting

## Justice (Ch 1)

- Price Gouging after a natural disaster
  - AI makes it more efficient
  
&gt; This is not the normal free market situation where willing buyers freely elect to enter into the marketplace and meet willing sellers, where a price is agreed upon based on supply and demand. In an emergency, buyers under duress have no freedom. Their purchases of necessities like save lodging are forced. (Charlie Crist)

---

class: bg_water

## Markets and Capitalism (sidenote)

- There's nothing inconsistent about believing that markets are a great way to sell computers and t-shirts but a poor way to distribute insulin. 

- Much like the price gouging question above, the question is not whether markets work in all circumstances (they don't) or if markets work in any circumstances (they do), the question is what circumstances do markets work well in and when are there other alternatives that might be better. 

- One reason to discuss this in some depth is because a lot of AI is aimed at increasing market efficiency

class: bg_water

## Welfare, Freedom, and Virtue

.pull-left[

### Let Markets Set Prices

- Welfare
  - Markets promote through incentive structure
  
- Freedom
  - Markets respect freedom of exchange
  
- Virtue
  - We don't all agree on virtue and markets don't impose

]


.pull-right[

### Stop Price Gouging

- Welfare
  - Clear harm to the price-gouged
  
- Freedom
  - Exchange under duress isn't free
  
- Virtue
  - Price gougers are greedy and taking advantage

]


???
What other types of freedom might we be concerned with?
What other types of good things outside of these 3 do we care about?

---

class: bg_water

## Do we really have to figure out what people deserve?

- The purple heart for PTSD?
- Bailouts for the financial sector?
  - Which are then spent on bonuses?
  - If the bad times are out of their control, do they deserve credit for the good times?
  
- Computer Science and Economics are both fields that seem to try very hard to avoid this question
  - They're also fields that produce a lot of data scientists
  
- The alternative to engaging in philosophy is settling philosophical questions without much thought and usually not very well.

class: bg_water

## Defining Justice

&gt; To ask whether a society is just is to ask how it distributes the things we prize - income and wealth, duties and rights, powers and opportunities, offices and honors. A just society distributes these goods in the right way; it gives each person his or her due. The hard questions begin when we ask what people are due, and why.

- Maximizing Welfare
  - Utilitarians and other consequentialists
  
- Freedom
  - Libertarians
  - Fairness and Positive Liberty (Rawls, Sen)

- Virtue
  - Aristotle
  - Religious Right and Religious Left
  
---

class: bg_water

## The Trolley Problem

- The Trolley
- The Organ Harvest

- Competing Principles
  - Welfare (save more people)
  - Freedom/Rights (wrong to kill an innocent even for a good purpose)
  
- In real life there's also uncertainty

- The Goatherds in Afghanistan

???
Goatherds problem is from Sandel p. 24

- June 2005 a special forces team encountered goatherds in Afghanistan
- Didn't know if they would inform others and didn't have a way to tie them up
- Kill or let go?
- They let go and 19 soldiers wound up killed
- Does it matter if goatherds were pro-taliban or were coerced by taliban?

---

class: bg_water

## Public Ethics

- Moral reflection comes from encountering difficult moral questions
- We move back and forth between acting in the world and reflecting on our actions
- We also engage with other people
- This is foundationally a pragmatic view of morality
- We don't just sit in an office and come up with some theory of the good life
- We have to actually live - and then also reflect how we're living.

# Main Theories of Justice

---

class: bg_water

## Utilitarianism (Welfare)

## Libertarianism (Freedom)

## Liberalism (Freedom)

## Virtue (Virtue)


---

class: bg_water center middle

# Utilitarianism

---

class: bg_water

# Utilitarianism

- Maximize happiness (utility)
- Pleasure is good, pain is bad. 

- Human rights only matter if they (long-term) maximize happiness
- Morality becomes a cost/benefit calculation

- This is a style of moral reasoning most people find intuitive

- Most versions are radically unselfish - your own happiness is not worth more than other people's

---

class: bg_water

## Singer's Thought Experiment

- Famine, Affluence, and Morality (1972)

- Suppose you're on your way to a job interview and pass a small child drowning in a pond
- The cost of saving the child is ruining your interview clothes and missing your interview
- Should you save the child? Why?



---

class: bg_water center middle

&gt; if it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it

Peter Singer

---

class: bg_water

## Singer's Thought Experiment (2)

- We save the child because the cost to us is relatively small and the gain for the child is substantial

- There are currently children dying of disease and starvation
- We could prevent that
- But we don't
- Why is it different?


---

class: bg_water center middle

&gt; If it [the principle of acting to prevent bad things from happening] were acted upon, our lives, our society, and our world would be fundamentally changed. For the principle takes, firstly, no account of proximity or distance. It makes no moral difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor's child ten yards from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten thousand miles away. Secondly, the principle makes no distinction between cases in which I am the only person who could possibly do anything and cases in which I am just one among millions in the same position

Peter Singer

---

class: bg_water

- In the drowning child example we are more likely to act because
  - We are nearby
  - We are the only one in a position to help
  - It is immediate
  
- Singer argues that these are psychological reasons we *don't* help, but not valid *moral* reasons

---

class: bg_water

## Objections to Utilitarianism

1. Human Rights
2. Measuring Utility is Impossible


???
1. Can we torture the daughter of a terrorist suspect? Can we kill people to harvest their organs if it saves more. What if the people we're killing are sad? 
2. John Stuart Mill walks back a lot of this

Utility constrained by human rights with a bit more selfishness than full utility would imply seems close to how people actually operate

---

class: bg_water center middle

&gt; It is better to be a human being dissastisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question

John Stuart Mill

---

class: bg_water center middle

# Libertarianism


---

class: bg_water center middle

&gt; only a minimal state limited to enforcing contracts and protecting people against force, theft, and fraud, is justified. Any more extensive state violates personal rights not to be forced to do certain things, and is unjustified

Robert Nozick

---

class: bg_water

## Libertarianism

- Individual liberty is most important good

- Two criteria for something to be just (Nozick)
  - Justice in initial state of holdings
  - Justice in transfer
  
- Notice that there's nothing about how happy people are or how equal people are. Only that they have the right to themselves and by extension to the results of their labor. 

- If in 1993, the City of Chicago had forced Michael Jordan to come out of retirement to play basketball that would clearly be wrong (perhaps not from a Utilitarian perspective). 
- Why is it then just to tax the earnings that he made from playing basketball, if it's unjust to force him to play?

---

class: bg_water

## Objections to Libertarianism

Sandel
1. Taxation != Forced Labor
2. The poor need the money more
3. Jordan (and others) don't work alone
4. Individuals implicitly consent to taxes by living in society 
5. Individuals are lucky to be born with the talents (and work ethic) they have

Others
6. Is Liberty The GOOD, or is it one of many good things?
7. Are there forms of power other than State power that should concern us?

???
related to 5 is the critique that humans don't come from nowhere. We don't just spring up from the ground like mushrooms. We have families, friends, neighbors, and a whole web of social relationships

---

class: bg_water

## Libertarians and AI

- Constant surveillance is a libertarian nightmare
- But people may also be consenting to their own surveillance

- How do libertarians feel about privacy? 

---

class: bg_water center middle

# Liberalism

---

class: bg_water

# Liberalism and John Rawls

- This is meant in the classic sense - not today's meaning of liberal

- There are a lot of variations on this possible, but we'll focus on John Rawls


---

class: bg_water

# How to choose the rules

- When we make rules for games, we try to push them towards our existing abilities
- When we make rules for society, the same thing happens
- In practice, this means those with power make rules that help them maintain power
- Is there a way to get a set of rules without this sort of bias?

# The Veil of Ignorance

- What if we didn't know our own abilities or our eventual position in society? 

---

class: bg_water

# Rules from the Veil

1. A system of rights as extensive as is compatible with the same rights for all.
2. Inequality is permitted only to the extent that it benefits the least well off.

- Rawls assumes we will be risk averse behind the veil.
- So we adopt a strategy of maximizing our worst possible position in society.

# Virtue


---

class: bg_water

# Sandel's critique of liberalism

1. Individuals don't come from nowhere, they are part of a community and part of a story
2. There is no way to be neutral on conceptions of the good life

---

class: bg_water center middle

&gt; Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts...the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the Gross National Product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom or our learning, neither our compassion nor our deviation to our contry. It measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. 

Robert F. Kennedy

---

class: bg_water

- A theory of justice that isn't neutral about conceptions of the good life requires a lot from citizens
- Robust discussions with those they disagree with
- A tolerance of ambiguous and competiting aims
- It's also a fairly vague theory.

- We'll return to it at the end of class
