## Ethics and Justice

- In a broad sense
    - Ethics: personal behavior
    - Justice: social institutions
    
- We will talk some about our personal ethical responsibilities as data scientists

- The question of how AI changes society is a question of Justice

    
- "Justice is what love looks like in public" - Cornel West

## Ethics as a matter of taste

- This is usually a criticism, and while I don't think it's a perfect analogy, there is something we can take from it.

- While tastes does vary some from person to person, in broad strokes it's actually pretty set
    - Humans like fat, sugar, salt, etc. 
    - Also food tastes better than things that aren't food
    - Within the range of things we agree are edible for humans, yes, there's variation
    - But we all agree that ice cream tastes better than dog shit
    
- Our tastes aren't well adapted to a situation where fat and sugar are plentiful. 

- Our ethical intuition is also not well adapted to the current situation
    - Our naturally good intentions may not be enough in a complicated world
    - Introducing complex AI into a complex society is pushing beyond our intuitive sense of ethics

## Ethical Progress

- There's actually been a lot of this.
    - We now think that it's not only white property holding men who count as people. 
    - That strikes me as more important than any of the technological advances of the past century.

- Sometimes studying ethics makes it seem like nothing is settled, but that's because it's the unsettled cases that are interesting
