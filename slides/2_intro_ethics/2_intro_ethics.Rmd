## Ethics and Justice

- In a broad sense
    - Ethics: personal behavior
    - Justice: social institutions
    
- We will talk some about our personal ethical responsibilities as data scientists

- The question of how AI changes society is a question of Justice

    
- "Justice is what love looks like in public" - Cornel West

## Ethics as a matter of taste

- This is usually a criticism, and while I don't think it's a perfect analogy, there is something we can take from it.

- While tastes does vary some from person to person, in broad strokes it's actually pretty set
    - Humans like fat, sugar, salt, etc. 
    - Also food tastes better than things that aren't food
    - Within the range of things we agree are edible for humans, yes, there's variation
    - But we all agree that ice cream tastes better than dog shit
    
- Our tastes aren't well adapted to a situation where fat and sugar are plentiful. 

- Our ethical intuition is also not well adapted to the current situation
    - Our naturally good intentions may not be enough in a complicated world
    - Introducing complex AI into a complex society is pushing beyond our intuitive sense of ethics

## Ethical Progress

- There's actually been a lot of this.
    - We now think that it's not only white property holding men who count as people. 
    - That strikes me as more important than any of the technological advances of the past century.

- Sometimes studying ethics makes it seem like nothing is settled, but that's because it's the unsettled cases that are interesting

## Justice (Ch 1)

- Price Gouging after a natural disaster
  - AI makes it more efficient
  
> This is not the normal free market situation where willing buyers freely elect to enter into the marketplace and meet willing sellers, where a price is agreed upon based on supply and demand. In an emergency, buyers under duress have no freedom. Their purchases of necessities like save lodging are forced. (Charlie Crist)

class: bg_water

## Markets and Capitalism (sidenote)

- There's nothing inconsistent about believing that markets are a great way to sell computers and t-shirts but a poor way to distribute insulin. 

- Much like the price gouging question above, the question is not whether markets work in all circumstances (they don't) or if markets work in any circumstances (they do), the question is what circumstances do markets work well in and when are there other alternatives that might be better. 

- One reason to discuss this in some depth is because a lot of AI is aimed at increasing market efficiency

## Welfare, Freedom, and Virtue

.pull-left[

### Let Markets Set Prices

- Welfare
  - Markets promote through incentive structure
  
- Freedom
  - Markets respect freedom of exchange
  
- Virtue
  - We don't all agree on virtue and markets don't impose

]


.pull-right[

### Stop Price Gouging

- Welfare
  - Clear harm to the price-gouged
  
- Freedom
  - Exchange under duress isn't free
  
- Virtue
  - Price gougers are greedy and taking advantage

]


???
What other types of freedom might we be concerned with?
What other types of good things outside of these 3 do we care about?

## Do we really have to figure out what people deserve?

- The purple heart for PTSD?
- Bailouts for the financial sector?
  - Which are then spent on bonuses?
  - If the bad times are out of their control, do they deserve credit for the good times?
  
- Computer Science and Economics are both fields that seem to try very hard to avoid this question
  - They're also fields that produce a lot of data scientists
  
- The alternative to engaging in philosophy is settling philosophical questions without much thought and usually not very well.

## Defining Justice

> To ask whether a society is just is to ask how it distributes the things we prize - income and wealth, duties and rights, powers and opportunities, offices and honors. A just society distributes these goods in the right way; it gives each person his or her due. The hard questions begin when we ask what people are due, and why.

- Maximizing Welfare
  - Utilitarians and other consequentialists
  
- Freedom
  - Libertarians
  - Fairness and Positive Liberty (Rawls, Sen)

- Virtue
  - Aristotle
  - Religious Right and Religious Left

## The Trolley Problem

- The Trolley
- The Organ Harvest

- Competing Principles
  - Welfare (save more people)
  - Freedom/Rights (wrong to kill an innocent even for a good purpose)
  
- In real life there's also uncertainty

- The Goatherds in Afghanistan

?? Goatherds problem is from Sandel p. 24

- June 2005 a special forces team encountered goatherds in Afghanistan
- Didn't know if they would inform others and didn't have a way to tie them up
- Kill or let go?
- They let go and 19 soldiers wound up killed
- Does it matter if goatherds were pro-taliban or were coerced by taliban?

## Public Ethics

- Moral reflection comes from encountering difficult moral questions
- We move back and forth between acting in the world and reflecting on our actions
- We also engage with other people
- This is foundationally a pragmatic view of morality
- We don't just sit in an office and come up with some theory of the good life
- We have to actually live - and then also reflect how we're living.

# Main Theories of Justice

--- 

class: bg_water

## Utilitarianism (Welfare)

## Libertarianism (Freedom)

## Liberalism (Freedom)

## Virtue (Virtue)


---

class: bg_water center middle

# Utilitarianism

---

class: bg_water

# Utilitarianism

- Maximize happiness (utility)
- Pleasure is good, pain is bad. 

- Human rights only matter if they (long-term) maximize happiness
- Morality becomes a cost/benefit calculation

- This is a style of moral reasoning most people find intuitive

- Most versions are radically unselfish - your own happiness is not worth more than other people's

## Singer's Thought Experiment

- Famine, Affluence, and Morality (1972)

- Suppose you're on your way to a job interview and pass a small child drowning in a pond
- The cost of saving the child is ruining your interview clothes and missing your interview
- Should you save the child? Why?

--- 

class: bg_water center middle

> if it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it

Peter Singer

---

class: bg_water

## Singer's Thought Experiment (2)

- We save the child because the cost to us is relatively small and the gain for the child is substantial

- There are currently children dying of disease and starvation
- We could prevent that
- But we don't
- Why is it different?

--- 

class: bg_water center middle

> If it [the principle of acting to prevent bad things from happening] were acted upon, our lives, our society, and our world would be fundamentally changed. For the principle takes, firstly, no account of proximity or distance. It makes no moral difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor's child ten yards from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten thousand miles away. Secondly, the principle makes no distinction between cases in which I am the only person who could possibly do anything and cases in which I am just one among millions in the same position

Peter Singer

--- 

class: bg_water

- In the drowning child example we are more likely to act because
  - We are nearby
  - We are the only one in a position to help
  - It is immediate
  
- Singer argues that these are psychological reasons we *don't* help, but not valid *moral* reasons

## Objections to Utilitarianism

1. Human Rights
2. Measuring Utility is Impossible


???
1. Can we torture the daughter of a terrorist suspect?
2. John Stuart Mill walks back a lot of this

class: bg_water center middle

> It is better to be a human being dissastisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question

John Stuart Mill
