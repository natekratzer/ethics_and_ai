## General AI or Current AI

- Currently, artificial intelligence is only capable of performing very specific tasks. Not more general ones
    - It's a vacuum, not a robot house cleaner
    - There is a goal to eventually have truly general AI that can reason about new problems
    
- There is discussion around the long-term dangers of AI
    - What would happen if we told a general AI to reduce human suffering as much as possible?

- We didn't specify a few things

## Current AI

- This sort of general AI does pose a lot of really fascinating ethical questions

- We're going to frame our initial discussion in terms of one of those AI systems: The Allegheny Family Screening Tool
